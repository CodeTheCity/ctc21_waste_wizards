# ctc21_waste_wizards

This is a project started as part of 
[CTC21: Put Your City on the Map](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/CTC21), 
which ran Saturday 28th Nov 2020 and Sunday 29th Nov 2020.

The aim is to provide Councils and citizens with a shared Open Data source of information about Council-run recycling options in their area.

We are exploring whether using a combination of OpenStreetMap and Wikidata to store and share raw data will leverage existing data standards for codifying locations, materials accepted, materials specifically banned, and opening hours.

We believe that there is a need for a custom UI for editing and display of the data, focussed on the subject. The generic editing facilities of OpenStreetMap and Wikidata could be used by data experts but are too generic for the general public and Councils.

## Household waste

Household waste is waste that is generated by a household

## Household waste recycling centres

A HWRC is a staffed household waste recycling centre, and is a place where residents can take household waste to be recycled, treated or disposed of. Each local authority area has a legal responsibility to provide this service to residents, and the service is usually provided in multiple sites across the local authority area. HWRCs might be known by different names in different areas, or by different people. Some examples of this are:

* civic amenity (CA) sites
* household-waste and recycling centres (HWRCs)
* household-waste sorting sites (HWSSs)
* household recycling centres (HRCs)
* household re-use and recycling centres (HRRCs)
* household-waste recovery centres (HWRCs)
* re-use and recycling centres (RRCs)
* recycling and waste centres (RWCs)
* tips
* dumps

### Useful bits'n'pieces

* A Household Waste and Recycling Centre (HWRC) is a Council-run location with multiple recycling and destined-for-landfill containers that may only be used by residents.
* A Household Recycling Point is a Council-run location, much smaller than a HWRC, with multiple recycling containers that anyone may recycle items. Often an area in a supermarket car park or by a Council building. Also known as a 'bring site'.
* Some Councils also place individual recycling containers, often more like a bin, on street locations. This is prevalent in Aberdeen.
